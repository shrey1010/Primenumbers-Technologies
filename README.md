# Web Scraping with Selenium

## Overview

This Python script demonstrates web scraping using Selenium to extract data from a table on a specific website. It uses a Chrome WebDriver to navigate to the desired URL, locate a table by its ID, and extract information from the table rows.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Selenium library (`pip install selenium`)
- Chrome WebDriver compatible with your Chrome browser version

## Usage

1. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure the required libraries are installed by running:

   ```bash
   pip install selenium
   ```

2. **Set Up Chrome WebDriver**

   Download the compatible Chrome WebDriver from [ChromeDriver Downloads](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/). Make sure the Chrome WebDriver version matches your Chrome browser version.

3. **Update Script**

   In the Python script:
   
   - Set the `url` variable to the target website.
   - Update the path to your Chrome WebDriver executable in the `webdriver.Chrome()` function.

4. **Run the Script**

   Execute the Python script using:

   ```bash
   python assignment.py
   ```

## Script Details

The script performs the following steps:

1. Initializes a Chrome WebDriver using Selenium.
2. Navigates to the specified URL.
3. Finds the table by its ID and extracts headers.
4. Retrieves the first five rows of data from the table.
5. Prints the extracted data for each row in a dictionary format, mapping headers to corresponding row values.

## Troubleshooting

- If encountering issues with WebDriver or accessing the table, ensure the correct WebDriver path is provided and that the table is accessible via the provided URL.
- Adjust the wait times in the script to ensure proper loading of the table data.
